    <h1> Welcome to Meals 2 Share!</h1>
    <p>
        At Meals 2 Share, we're on a mission to tackle food waste and nourish our community. Founded by newlyweds Mindy
        and Mike, who come from a background in sustainable farming, we're more than just a restaurant – we're a
        movement towards a more sustainable future.</p>

    <h3>Our Story:</h3>
    <p>Mindy and Mike's journey began with a deep-seated commitment to combating food waste in our local area. Seeing
        the abundance of fresh produce going to waste, they decided to take action. They established a nonprofit
        organization dedicated to diverting food from supermarkets and distributors, transforming it into delicious
        meals for our patrons.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Vision:</h3>
    <p>Meals 2 Share is not just about providing nourishing meals; it's about fostering a sense of community and
        empowerment. We believe that everyone should have access to fresh, nutritious food, regardless of their
        financial circumstances. That's why we operate on a "Pay As You Feel" basis – ensuring that everyone can enjoy a
        meal with dignity and autonomy.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Offer:</h3>
    <p>
        A Rotating Menu: Our daily menu is crafted using diverted fresh food, ensuring that every meal is not only
        delicious but also sustainable.
        <br><br>
        Fresh Food Boxes: Subscribe to our weekly food box service and receive fresh fruits, vegetables, and cupboard
        goods, sourced directly from local markets and grocery stores.
        <br><br>
        Volunteer Opportunities: We welcome volunteers who wish to contribute their time and skills in exchange for food
        box collection. It's a chance to give back to the community and make a difference.
    </p>

    <h3>Join Us:</h3>
